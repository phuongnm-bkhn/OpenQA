The various states use 15 different names. Depending upon the specific law, the state holiday may officially celebrate Washington alone, Washington and Lincoln, or some other combination of U.S. presidents (such as Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who was born in April).Washington's Birthday was celebrated on February 22 from 1879 until 1970. To give federal employees a three-day weekend, in 1968 the Uniform Monday Holiday Act moved it to the third Monday in February, which can occur from February 15 to the 21st. The day soon became known as Presidents(') Day (the placement of the apostrophe, if any, varies) and provides an occasion to remember all U.S. presidents, or to honor Abraham Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays together.As states and cities followed suit, those that had been celebrating Lincoln's birthday on February 12 combined the two into Presidents Day.

Context: b'<s>what is the QA system?</s></s>is used to describe the fifth phase of the define, measure, analyze, improve, control (DMAIC) model. DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes.Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities implemented in a quality system so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be fulfilled. It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention. This can be contrasted with quality control, which is focused on process output.Quality assurance includes two principles: "fit for purpose" (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); and "right first time" (mistakes should be eliminated). QA includes ____[ management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and management, production and inspection processes]____ . The two principles also manifest before the background of developing (engineering) a novel technical product: The task of engineering is to make it work once, while the task of quality assurance is to make it work all the time.Historically, defining what suitable product or service quality means has been a more difficult process, determined in many ways, from the subjective user-based approach that contains "the different weights that individuals normally attach to quality characteristics," to the value-based approach which finds consumers linking quality to price and making overall conclusions of quality based on such a relationship.</s>'

Context: b"<s>What's the color of the sky</s></s> == Color == Earth's atmosphere scatters short-wavelength light more efficiently than that of longer wavelengths. Because its wavelengths are shorter,  blue light is more strongly scattered than the longer-wavelength lights, red or green. Hence, the result that when looking at the sky away from the direct incident sunlight, the human eye perceives the sky to be ____[ blue]____ . The color perceived is similar to that presented by a monochromatic blue (at wavelength 474\xe2\x80\x93476 nm) mixed with white light, that is, an unsaturated blue light. The explanation of blue color by Rayleigh in 1871 is a famous example of applying dimensional analysis to solving problems in physics;  (see top figure).\nScattering and absorption are major causes of the attenuation of sunlight radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies as a function of the ratio of particle diameters (of particulates in the atmosphere) to the wavelength of the incident radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, Rayleigh scattering occurs. (In this case, the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger ratios scattering varies in a more complex fashion, as described for spherical particles by the Mie theory.) The laws of geometric optics begin to apply at higher ratios.\nDaily at any global venue experiencing sunrise or sunset, most of the solar beam of visible sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to Earth's surface. Here, the path of sunlight through the atmosphere is elongated such that much of the blue or green light is scattered away from the</s>"

He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophi\xc3\xa6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.\nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System\'s heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\'s inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.

He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow." His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant\'s Critique of Pure Reason.

Its sections had been preserved in alcohol in two large mason jars within a cider box for over 20 years.\nThe brain was driven across many U.S. states and to Hamilton, Ontario, accompanied by Harvey. A journalist cum chauffeur, Michael Paterniti, wrote about some of the journeying that took place in 1997.In 2010, Harvey's heirs transferred all of his holdings constituting the remains of Einstein's brain to the National Museum of Health and Medicine. This included 14 photographs of the whole brain (which was now in fragments), never before revealed to the public.More recently, 46 small portions of Einstein's brain were acquired by the M\xc3\xbctter Museum in Philadelphia. In 2013, segments of the brain went on exhibit in the museum's permanent galleries. The exhibit featured thin slices of Einstein's brain, mounted on microscope slides.</s>"

He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and Nick Higham described him as "perhaps the most neglected of English kings", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.</s>'

The film is a poetic treatment of the life of 18th-century Armenian poet and troubadour Sayat-Nova. It has appeared in many polls as one of the greatest films ever made and was hailed as revolutionary by Mikhail Vartanov. The film is now regarded as a landmark in film history. == Overview ==\nThe Color of Pomegranates is a biography of the Armenian ashug Sayat-Nova (King of Song) that attempts to reveal the poet\'s life visually and poetically rather than literally. The film is presented with little dialogue using active tableaux which depict the poet\'s life in chapters: Childhood, Youth, Prince\'s Court (where he falls in love with a tsarina), The Monastery, The Dream, Old Age, The Angel of Death and Death. There are sounds and music and occasional singing but dialogue is rare. Each chapter is indicated by a title card and framed through both Sergei Parajanov\'s imagination and Sayat Nova\'s poems. Actress Sofiko Chiaureli notably plays six roles in the film, both male and female. According to Frank Williams, Parajanov\'s film celebrates the survival of Armenian culture in face of oppression and persecution, "There are specific images that are highly charged\xe2\x80\x94blood- ____[red juice]____  spilling from a cut pomegranate into a cloth and forming a stain in the shape of the boundaries of the ancient</s>'

Context: b"<s>Who is the little?</s></s>  The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is a 1976 cross-genre film directed by Nicolas Gessner and starring Jodie Foster, Martin Sheen, Alexis Smith, Mort Shuman, and Scott Jacoby. It was a co-production of Canada and France and written by Laird Koenig, based on his 1974 novel of the same title.\nThe plot focuses on 13-year-old ____[ Rynn Jacobs]____  (Foster), a child whose absent poet father and secretive behaviours prod the suspicions of her conservative small-town Maine neighbours. The adaptation, originally intended as a play, was filmed in Quebec on a small budget. The production later became the subject of controversy over reports that Foster had conflicts with producers over the filming and inclusion of a nude scene, but a 21-year-old body double (Foster's sister) was used. After a screening at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, a court challenge was launched regarding distribution, and a general release followed in 1977.\nInitially released to mixed reviews, with some critics finding the murder mystery plot weak but Jodie Foster's performance more meritorious, the film won two Saturn Awards, including Best Horror Film and Best Actress for Foster. It subsequently attained cult status, with later critics positively reviewing the screenplay. Writers and academics have interpreted it as a statement on children's rights and variously placed it in the thriller, horror, mystery or other genres.</s>"

The answer was not \'on average directly above\'. Rather it was \'on average, more ____[ towards the middle]____ \', for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards. === Evolving usage of the term ===\nGalton coined the term "regression" to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits: namely that the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution will tend to lie closer to the centre, the mean, of the distribution. He quantified this trend, and in doing so invented linear regression analysis, thus laying the groundwork for much of modern statistical modelling. Since then, the term "regression" has taken on a variety of meanings, and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena of sampling bias which have little to do with Galton\'s original observations in the field of genetics.\nThough his mathematical analysis was correct, Galton\'s biological explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed is now known to be incorrect.

An outstanding student, Shen Chia-yi, is popular among her teachers and classmates. Ko Ching-teng, a mischievous and poor student, claims that he has no interest in her, despite being her classmate since junior high school. One day, Ching-teng is caught masturbating during class, and the principal reseats him, placing him in front of Chia-yi.\nOne day, Chia-yi forgets her English textbook. Ching-teng slips her his own book and tells their teacher he forgot his own textbook; he then endures a long lecture and is punished. Chia-yi, touched by Ching-teng\'s generosity, prepares a practice exam for him in return, to encourage him to study. She also convinces him to stay after school to study with her. Their relationship grows, and Ching-teng\'s grades gradually improve.\nOn graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the National Chiao Tung University. Chia-Yi, who did not do well on the admission exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the National Taipei University of Education with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing she would say no, he decides that he would rather not hear her answer (it is revealed later that her reply would have been "yes").

Previously the 20th vice president, he succeeded to the presidency upon the death of President James A. Garfield in September 1881, two months after Garfield was shot by an assassin.\nArthur was born in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York and practiced law in New York City. He served as quartermaster general of the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to New York Republican politics and quickly rose in Senator Roscoe Conkling's political organization. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him to the post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, and he was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, and Arthur was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket as an Eastern Stalwart. Four months into his term, Garfield was shot by an assassin; he died 11 weeks later, and Arthur assumed the presidency.\nAt the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a negative reputation as a Stalwart and product of Conkling's organization. To the surprise of reformers, he advocated and enforced the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act.</s>"

Context: b'<s>Why the road?</s></s>  "Why did the chicken cross the road?" is a common riddle joke, with the answer being " ____[To get to the other side]____ ". It is commonly seen as an example of anti-humor, in that the curious setup of the joke leads the listener to expect a traditional punchline, but they are instead given a simple statement of fact. Some also see the phrase "other side" as the afterlife, suggesting that it is not anti-humor. "Why did the chicken cross the road?" has become iconic as an exemplary generic joke to which most people know the answer, and has been repeated and changed numerous times over the course of history. == History == The riddle appeared in an 1847 edition of The Knickerbocker, a New York City monthly magazine: There are \'quips and quillets\' which seem actual conundrums, but yet are none.  Of such is this:  \'Why does a chicken cross the street?[\'] Are you \'out of town?\'    Do you \'give it up?\'  Well, then:  \'Because it wants to get on the other side!\'</s>'

Context: b'<s>Why is the Internet?</s></s> == History ==\nThe main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance, able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not. Mark Weiser\'s 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT. In 1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories". Between 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft\'s at Work or Novell\'s NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as a part of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.The concept of the "Internet of things" and the term itself, first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis, to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C, published in September 1985. According to Lewis, "The Internet of Things, or IoT, is the ____[ integration of people, processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring, status, manipulation and evaluation of trends of such devices]____ ."\nThe term "Internet of things" was coined independently by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT\'s Auto-ID Center, in 1999, though he prefers the</s>'

While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly strong role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, with a notable expansion during the presidency of Franklin D.

As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests the executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy.

Context: b'<s>when was newton born?</s></s>  Sir Isaac Newton  ( ____[25 December 1642]____  \xe2\x80\x93 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophi\xc3\xa6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.\nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System\'s heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\'s inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.

If submarine mountains are included, the longest is the global mid-ocean ridge system which extends for about 65,000 km (40,389 mi). == Formation ==\nMountain chains are typically formed by the process of plate tectonics. Tectonic plates slide very slowly over the Earth's mantle, a lower place of rock that is heated from the Earth's interior. Several huge sections of the earth's crust are impelled by heat currents in the mantle, producing tremendous forces that can buckle the material at the edges of the plates to form mountains. Usually one plate is forced underneath the other, and the lower plate is slowly absorbed by the mantle. Where the two plates pass one another, heated rock from the mantle can burst through the crust to form volcanoes. The movement of the plates against one another can also cause earthquakes.</s>"

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal government as a whole. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly strong role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, with a notable expansion during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In contemporary times, the president is also looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global superpower.  As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests the executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy.

Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a federal government. Washington has been called the "Father of the Nation" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country.Washington\'s first public office was serving as official Surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his initial military training (as well as a command with the Virginia Regiment) during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress. Here he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army. With this title, he commanded American forces (allied with France) in the defeat and surrender of the British at the Siege of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War. He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783.\nWashington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution of the United States. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously.

Context: b'<s>when was the first president of us born?</s></s> == Early life (1732\xe2\x80\x931752) == The Washington family was a wealthy Virginia planter family that had made its fortune through land speculation and the cultivation of tobacco. Washington\'s great-grandfather John Washington emigrated in 1656 from Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England, to the English colony of Virginia where he accumulated 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of land, including Little Hunting Creek on the Potomac River. George Washington was born on ____[ February 22, 1732]____ , at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, in the British colony of Virginia, and was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735. In 1738, they moved to Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia on the Rappahannock River. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.\nWashington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield. He learned mathematics, trigonometry, and land surveying and became a talented draftsman and map-maker. By early adulthood, he was writing with "considerable force" and "precision"; however, his writing displayed little wit or humor. In pursuit of admiration, status, and power, he tended to attribute his shortcomings and failures to someone else\'s ineffectuality.Washington often visited Mount Vernon and</s>'

Context: b"<s>20the person invented the light</s></s>  ____[ William Potts]____  (May 1883 \xe2\x80\x93 1947), a Detroit police officer, is credited with inventing the modern, three-lens traffic light in Detroit in 1920. (The two-lens, red/green traffic signal was invented in London in 1868 by John Peake Knight). == Biography ==\nWilliam Potts was born in Bad Axe, Michigan. The 1900 census lists Potts as 17 years old and a police officer. By 1910, he was married to Grace (Baker) Potts, and they subsequently had 4 children. Potts became the 'superintendent, signal person police' for the city of Detroit.\nThe old system of police directing traffic had become increasing outmoded; two-color signals, with green and red lights, already existed, but they did not leave drivers sufficient time to stop at high speeds. Some municipalities experimented with leaving the green on for a few seconds after the red was illuminated, to caution the driver that the right of way was soon to change. In 1917, Potts devised a new system by inventing a 'yellow' or 'amber' light which would shine after the green light and before the red light to indicate the impending transition.In 1920, Potts designed the first four-way, three-color traffic signal tower, which was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan Avenues in Detroit in October 1920.</s>"

Neon glowed a brilliant red when used in Geissler tubes. By 1910, ____[ Georges Claude]____ , a Frenchman who had developed a technology and a successful business for air liquefaction, was obtaining enough neon as a byproduct to support a neon lighting industry. While neon lighting was used around 1930 in France for general illumination, it was no more energy-efficient than conventional incandescent lighting. Neon tube lighting, which also includes the use of argon and mercury vapor as alternative gases, came to be used primarily for eye-catching signs and advertisements. Neon lighting was relevant to the development of fluorescent lighting, however, as Claude\'s improved electrode (patented in 1915) overcame "sputtering", a major source of electrode degradation. Sputtering occurred when ionized particles struck an electrode and tore off bits of metal. Although Claude\'s invention required electrodes with a lot of surface area, it showed that a major impediment to gas-based lighting could be overcome.\nThe development of the neon light also was significant for the last key element of the fluorescent lamp, its fluorescent coating. In 1926 Jacques Risler received a French patent for the application of fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes. The main use of these lamps, which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents, was for advertising, not general illumination. This, however, was not the first use</s>'

Since the gang\'s creation, it has branched throughout the United States. == History ==\nThe Bloods gang was formed initially to compete against the influence of the Crips in Los Angeles. The rivalry originated in the 1960s when Raymond Washington and other Crips attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School in Compton, California. As a result, Scott formed the Piru street-gang, the first "Bloods" gang. Owens subsequently established the West Piru gang. The Bloods was initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. Many of the non-Crip gangs used to call one another "blood". On March 21, 1972, shortly after a concert featuring Wilson Pickett and Curtis Mayfield, 20 youths belonging to the Crips attacked and robbed Robert Ballou Jr. outside the Hollywood Palladium. Ballou was beaten to death after refusing to give up his leather jacket. The sensational media coverage of the crime and the continued assaults by the Crips increased their notoriety.

Washington\'s great-grandfather John Washington emigrated in 1656 from Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England, to the English colony of Virginia where he accumulated 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of land, including Little Hunting Creek on the Potomac River. George Washington was born on ____[ February 22, 1732]____ , at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, in the British colony of Virginia, and was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735. In 1738, they moved to Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia on the Rappahannock River. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.\nWashington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield. He learned mathematics, trigonometry, and land surveying and became a talented draftsman and map-maker. By early adulthood, he was writing with "considerable force" and "precision"; however, his writing displayed little wit or humor. In pursuit of admiration, status, and power, he tended to attribute his shortcomings and failures to someone else\'s ineffectuality.Washington often visited Mount Vernon and</s>'

Although he was not a Socinian, he shared many similar beliefs with them. They were a unitarian Reformation movement in Poland. A manuscript he sent to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity was never published. In 2019, John Rogers stated, "Heretics both, John Milton and Isaac Newton were, as most scholars now agree, Arians."Newton refused the sacrament of the Anglican church offered before his death.After his death, Deists sometimes claimed him as one of their own, as have Trinitarians.

Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a federal government. Washington has been called the "Father of the Nation" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country.Washington\'s first public office was serving as official Surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his initial military training (as well as a command with the Virginia Regiment) during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress. Here he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army. With this title, he commanded American forces (allied with France) in the defeat and surrender of the British at the Siege of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War.

His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy, and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed, with John Adams defeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election. After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings until Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the Democratic-Republican Party split. The election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years. Jacksonian democracy sought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became unpopular after the Panic of 1837, and</s>"

Washington's great-grandfather John Washington emigrated in 1656 from Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England, to the English colony of Virginia where he accumulated 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of land, including Little Hunting Creek on the Potomac River. George Washington was born on ____[ February 22, 1732]____ , at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, in the British colony of Virginia, and was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735. In 1738, they moved to Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia on the Rappahannock River. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon. Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield.

Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma. Vertebrate blood is ____[ bright red]____  when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin</s>'

Context: b"<s>can you speak vietnamese</s></s>Vietnamese cuisine encompasses the foods and beverages of Vietnam, and features a combination of five fundamental tastes (Vietnamese: ____[ ng\xc5\xa9 v\xe1\xbb\x8b \xe4\xba\x94\xe5\x91\xb3]____ ) in overall meals. Each Vietnamese dish has a distinctive flavor which reflects one or more of these elements. Vietnamese recipes use lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chili, lime, and Thai basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking has often been characterised with using fresh ingredients, not much use of dairy nor oil, interesting textures, and the use of herbs and vegetables. A leading soy sauce manufacturer's research confirms that fish sauce (n\xc6\xb0\xe1\xbb\x9bc m\xe1\xba\xafm) is the predominant table sauce in Vietnamese homes, where it captures over 70% of the market, while the market share for soy sauce is under 20%. It is also low in sugar and is almost always naturally gluten-free, as many of the dishes are made with rice noodles, rice papers and rice flour instead of wheat.</s>"

In 1996, the album was reissued on CD. This re-release was remixed and remastered by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson; some of the elements from the original mixes were eliminated or changed, including an alternate guitar track on "Music Must Change", while other elements were restored, such as "Trick of the Light" being restored to its full length of 4:45. This remaster included five bonus tracks: outtakes "Empty Glass" and "No Road Romance", and alternate mixes for "Guitar and Pen", "Love Is Coming Down", and "Who Are You". On 24 December 2011, Universal Japan reissued the original analogue mixes of the album on limited, numbered edition SHM-CD, remastered by Jon Astley. The bonus tracks from the 1996 album were also included using vintage mixes where possible; however, the full band version of "No Road Romance" was included instead of Townshend\'s demo from the 1996 issue. The album was reissued in a miniature replica of the vinyl album for CD. In 2014, the album was released in its original mixes on HDtracks and iTunes,<sep> ____[]____ <cls>'

Ronald Reagan, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help re-shape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch</s>'

Since the gang\'s creation, it has branched throughout the United States. == History == The Bloods gang was formed initially to compete against the influence of the Crips in Los Angeles. The rivalry originated in the 1960s when Raymond Washington and other Crips attacked Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, two students at Centennial High School in Compton, California. As a result, Scott formed the Piru street-gang, the first "Bloods" gang. Owens subsequently established the West Piru gang. The Bloods was initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. Many of the non-Crip gangs used to call one another "blood".

A similar question does not involve whether or not an unobserved event occurs predictably, like it occurs when it is observed.

However, most people, as well as scientists, assume that the observer doesn\'t change whether the tree-fall causes a sound or not, but this is an impossible claim to prove. However, many scientists would argue that a truly unobserved event is one which realises no effect (imparts no information) on any other (where \'other\' might be e.g., human, sound-recorder or rock), it therefore can have no legacy in the present (or ongoing) wider physical universe.

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter</s>'

Context: b"<s>how to make coffee?</s></s>Brewed coffee is made by ____[ pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans]____ , then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot. == History == Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made</s>"

A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the International Journal of Digital Earth concludes that the Nile is longer.Even when detailed maps are available, the length measurement is not always clear. A river may have multiple channels, or anabranches. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be clear how to measure</s>'

Context: b"<s>how to make the coffee?</s></s>Brewed coffee is made by ____[ pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans]____ , then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot. == History == Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made</s>"

Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). The most abundant cells in vertebrate blood are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is mostly transported extracellularly as bicarbonate ion transported in plasma. Vertebrate blood is ____[ bright red]____  when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated. Some animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to</s>'

There is also the issue of color correction, as the cameras on board the rovers do not have wind shield wipers or self cleaning apparatus. Dust in the Martian sky can alter the color towards salmon, brown, or butterscotch. Ice crystals in the Martian sky can alter the color towards violet. water on the dust gives the sky a pinkish hue. If ice and dust are low, the area of the sky near the sun can appear quite blue. Here's another swatch. I made this one from a selection of pictures of the sky on Mars that are considered true color.

Context: b'<s> what color of the blood </s></s> ____[Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated]____ . It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.5 mm deep or more. Blood is red. Blood red can be a bright red or a dark red. The bright red color of crimson is often considered the color of fresh blood, thus blood red. Blood red may also describe a darker, more maroon shade of red. Blood red shades of red: 1 Blood Red | Hex #660000 | RGB 102,0,0. 2 Crimson | Hex #DC143C | RGB 220,20,60. Red blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color. Red blood cells are red because the iron in the heme group of the four hemoglobin proteins react with oxygen (think what color rust is) to produce a red color.+ 117 others found this</s>'

Erythrocytes are called red blood cells because they have hemoglobin, an iron containing pigment. The color of plasma is yellow due to presence of bilirubin, a degradation product of RBC and carotene. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Blood is bright red when it contains oxygen, and it is a dark reddish-maroon when it doesn't contain oxygen. It is never blue, even when it is inside the body. The blue color is simply the veins themselves with dark blood within. They show up as blue because they are under the skin, and blue is the only (visible) wavelength with enough energy to penetrate that deep and reflect back out. Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue</s>"

The 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given is officially recognised by Nepal and China, although Nepal is planning a new survey. In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometric Survey. Mount Everest stands 29,028 feet tall. From top to bottom, it's taller than any other mountain--whose bottom is the surface of the earth. Here's the catch: If you add what's underneath, then Mount Everest isn't the tallest mountain. The winner then is Mauna Kea, a huge, very tall volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii (called Hawaii). Mauna Kea stretches 13,796 above water and 19,680 underwater, for a total of 33,476! So if you say that it's the whole mountain that counts, then Mauna Kea is the tallest.</s>"

Context: b"<s>what is the color of the blood</s></s>#5. fargoth. The ____[ red to dark red]____  color of the blood is due to the large numbers of circulating red blood cells, the erythrocytes. Erythrocytes are called red blood cells because they have hemoglobin, an iron containing pigment. The color of plasma is yellow due to presence of bilirubin, a degradation product of RBC and carotene. Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Blood is bright red when it contains oxygen, and it is a dark reddish-maroon when it doesn't contain oxygen. It is never blue, even when it is inside the body. The blue color is simply the veins themselves with dark blood within. They show up as blue because they are under the skin, and blue is the only (visible) wavelength with enough energy to penetrate that deep and reflect back out. Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue</s>"

Context: b"<s>why the color of sky is blue</s></s>The sky is blue because ____[ light scatters off the atmospheric gasses]____ . Light scatter more strongly at the blue end of the the visible spectrum then red.So, looking away from the sun into the sky you see more blue than other colors. Another reason why the sea appears blue is because the water droplets of the sea act as a mirror and reflects the color of the sky. If the sky is cloudless or if it is a clear sunny day, then water reflects blue color of the sky. This makes the sea water blue. Only three other minerals-gold, silver and copper have a color that is used in common language more than turquoise. Blue minerals are rare and that is why turquoise captures attention in the gemstone market. The most desirable color of turquoise is a sky blue or robin's egg blue.Some people inappropriately describe the color as Persian blue after the famous high quality material mined in the area that is now known as Iraq.nly three other minerals-gold, silver and copper have a color that is used in common language more than turquoise.

Hello, Syedrafay, and welcome! The United States has 50 states, and there are 50 stars on the flag. This has been the case since July 4th, 1960, when the 50th star was added for the new state of Hawaii. I have heard this strange story about 52 states before, and it is very puzzling -- I can't imagine where it came from. The United States flag has 13 stripes - 7 red and 6 white. Red stripes are on both top and bottom edges. The stripes represent the original 13 states of the union. They were Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.

By land area only (exclusive of waters), the United States is the world\'s third largest country, after Russia and China, with Canada in fourth.

Former U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt was the one who launched the Manhattan Project to develop the A-bomb in the first place. In this shocking spiritual message, the spirits of both former presidents truthfully speak about WWII.

There was little scope for further conventional bombing. He was left with the choice of ordering an invasion of Japan's home islands or using the atomic bomb.Rather than risk the predicted 1,000,000 American battle casualties in an amphibious assault on Japan, President Truman elected to use the atomic bomb.hat President Truman said about America using the atomic bomb on Japan. In examining this topic, it is important to have regard to the considerations that led to President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan.</s>"

Context: b'<s>what color of the blood?</s></s>#5. fargoth. The ____[ red to dark red]____  color of the blood is due to the large numbers of circulating red blood cells, the erythrocytes. Erythrocytes are called red blood cells because they have hemoglobin, an iron containing pigment. The color of plasma is yellow due to presence of bilirubin, a degradation product of RBC and carotene. Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.5 mm deep or more. Red blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color. Red blood cells are red because the iron in the heme group of the four hemoglobin proteins react with oxygen (think what color rust is) to produce a red color.+ 117 others found this useful.ed blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red</s>'

Context: b'<s>what is the color of the blood?</s></s>Blood is ____[ red]____ . Blood red can be a bright red or a dark red. The bright red color of crimson is often considered the color of fresh blood, thus blood red. Blood red may also describe a darker, more maroon shade of red. Blood red shades of red: 1 Blood Red | Hex #660000 | RGB 102,0,0. 2 Crimson | Hex #DC143C | RGB 220,20,60. Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.5 mm deep or more. Red blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color. Red blood cells are red because the iron in the heme group of the four hemoglobin proteins react with oxygen (think what color rust is) to produce a red color.+ 117 others found this useful.ed blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color.

The color of a star depends on its surface temperature. Our Suns surface temperature is about 6,000 Kelvin. Although it looks yellow from here on Earth, the light of the Sun would actually look very white from space. This white light coming off of the Sun is because its temperature is 6,000 Kelvin.

Best Answer: Blood is ____[ bright red]____  when it contains oxygen, and it is a dark reddish-maroon when it doesn't contain oxygen. It is never blue, even when it is inside the body. The blue color is simply the veins themselves with dark blood within. They show up as blue because they are under the skin, and blue is the only (visible) wavelength with enough energy to penetrate that deep and reflect back out. Blood is red. Blood red can be a bright red or a dark red. The bright red color of crimson is often considered the color of fresh blood, thus blood red. Blood red may also describe a darker, more maroon shade of red. Blood red shades of red: 1 Blood Red | Hex #660000 | RGB 102,0,0. 2 Crimson | Hex #DC143C | RGB 220,20,60. The bright red color of arterial blood stems from a complex thats formed between hemoglobin, iron, and molecular oxygen.

This process is called ____[ cold brewing]____ , and will allow you to make low acid coffee in both hot and iced forms. Experiment with Instant Coffee. Instant coffee is made by brewing coffee beans and then removing the water content via freeze-drying. The end result is a concentrated instant powder. To make a coffee you simply add this powder to a glass of hot water and you have something that some say resembles coffee.</s>"

Best Answer: Blood is ____[ bright red]____  when it contains oxygen, and it is a dark reddish-maroon when it doesn't contain oxygen. It is never blue, even when it is inside the body. The blue color is simply the veins themselves with dark blood within. They show up as blue because they are under the skin, and blue is the only (visible) wavelength with enough energy to penetrate that deep and reflect back out. Blood is red. Blood red can be a bright red or a dark red. The bright red color of crimson is often considered the color of fresh blood, thus blood red. Blood red may also describe a darker, more maroon shade of red. Blood red shades of red: 1 Blood Red | Hex #660000 | RGB 102,0,0. 2 Crimson | Hex #DC143C | RGB 220,20,60. The bright red color of arterial blood stems from a complex thats formed between hemoglobin, iron, and molecular oxygen. This complex mainly absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) blue and green light, leaving behind primarily just red wavelengths for our eyes to detect.</s>"

Context: b"____[<s>what the color of the sky?</s></s>The color sky magenta]____  is a representation of the color of the sky near the sun during the brief period during twilight when the pink of sunset transitions into the blue of early evening. This color was one of the colors in the set of Venus Paradise colored pencils, a popular brand of colored pencils in the 1950s. Dust in the Martian sky can alter the color towards salmon, brown, or butterscotch. Ice crystals in the Martian sky can alter the color towards violet. water on the dust gives the sky a pinkish hue. If ice and dust are low, the area of the sky near the sun can appear quite blue. Here's another swatch. I made this one from a selection of pictures of the sky on Mars that are considered true color.

The reason the sky is ____[ blue]____  is because the sun's light scatters when it enters the atmosphere, and the color blue scatters the best of any of the colors (as the sun's light is white, it contains all colors). Dust in the Martian sky can alter the color towards salmon, brown, or butterscotch. Ice crystals in the Martian sky can alter the color towards violet. water on the dust gives the sky a pinkish hue. If ice and dust are low, the area of the sky near the sun can appear quite blue. Here's another swatch. I made this one from a selection of pictures of the sky on Mars that are considered true color.

Context: b'<s>what is the color of the blood?</s></s>Blood is ____[ red]____ . Blood red can be a bright red or a dark red. The bright red color of crimson is often considered the color of fresh blood, thus blood red. Blood red may also describe a darker, more maroon shade of red. Blood red shades of red: 1 Blood Red | Hex #660000 | RGB 102,0,0. 2 Crimson | Hex #DC143C | RGB 220,20,60. Human blood is red in color, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to a very dark, almost blackish-red when deoxygenated. It owes its color to haemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. Deoxygenated blood is darker due to the difference in color between deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin. The blue appearance of surface veins is caused mostly by the scattering of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.5 mm deep or more. Red blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color. Red blood cells are red because the iron in the heme group of the four hemoglobin proteins react with oxygen (think what color rust is) to produce a red color.+ 117 others found this useful.ed blood is red because the color of oxyhemoglobin is red because there is iron in oxyhemoglobin, causing that blood red color.

Context: b'<s>what is the karatedo?</s></s> ____[Goju Ryu Karatedo is said to display the oldest martial arts traditions and movements]____ . The system is based on the concept of hard (go) and soft (ju) , always in consistent harmony one equalizing the other. The art combines traditional Okinawan techniques with both internal and external Chinese principles. These characters are read in Japanese as Shorinji kempo. In other words Shorinji kempo are the fighting arts derived from the Shaolin temple. Kempo became the main form of spiritual discipline for the Buddhist monks in the Shaolin monastery. Wall paintings can still be seen in the temple today, of Indian monks practicing and teaching kempo to Chinese monks. Many forms of kempo developed from the Shorinji arts, and many modern martial arts, such as Okinawan karatedo, are rooted in Chinese kempo. Karate is primarily a striking martial art that emerged on the island of Okinawa as a blend of native Okinawan fighting styles and Chinese fighting styles. There are numerous karate styles being practiced today all over the world, making it one of the most popular fighting styles in existence.</s>'

These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners. The history of chocolate cake goes back to 1764, when Dr. James Baker discovered how to make chocolate ____[ by grinding cocoa beans between two massive circular millstones]____ . In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was ""rock cacao"" or ground into powder. The processes Chocolate the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual. Cacao plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction. New processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts</s>'

His ""Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" is considered to be one of the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics by describing universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. Because of the resounding impact of his work, Newton became a scientific icon, much like Albert Einstein after his "Isaac Newton" 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643) ""an hour or two after midnight"", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.

His ""Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" is considered to be one of the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics by describing universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus.

Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover of the ""Naruto"" manga volume three. In animated versions of the manga, Kakashi has been voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese. Inoue was surprised "Masaki Kaji" to perm his hair for his character.

Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.

Boiling points may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325 kPa (or 1 atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000 kPa.

Context: b'<s>what is the color of the cloud?</s></s>"Atmospheric optics" sky models for modelling sky luminance under weather conditions ranging from clear sky to overcast. The color of a cloud, as seen from the Earth, tells much about what is going on inside the cloud. Dense deep tropospheric clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70% to 95%) throughout the visible spectrum. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic ____[ white]____  color, especially when viewed from the top. Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with "Atmospheric optics" By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, it may be that a percentage of the light which enters the cloud is not reflected back out before it is absorbed. A simple example of this is being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black. Other colors occur naturally in clouds. Bluish-grey is the</s>'

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa</s>'

After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa.

After the War of 1812, during which Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew. During the 18th century, coffee consumption declined in England, giving way to tea-drinking. The latter beverage was simpler to make and had become cheaper with the British conquest of India and the tea industry there. During the Age of Sail, seamen aboard ships of the British Royal Navy made substitute coffee by ____[ dissolving burnt bread in hot water]____ .The Frenchman Gabriel de Clieu took a coffee plant to the French territory of Martinique in the Caribbean in the 1720s, from which much of the world's cultivated arabica coffee is descended. Coffee thrived in the climate and was conveyed across the Americas. Coffee was cultivated in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. The conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to follow Haitian Revolution. The coffee industry never fully recovered there.

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa.

The most recent years without known deaths on the mountain are 1977, in which only two people reached the summit, and 2020, when permits were suspended by Nepal because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Deaths have been attributed to avalanches, falls, serac collapse, exposure, frostbite, or health problems related to conditions on the mountain. Not all bodies have been located, so details on those deaths are not available. The upper reaches of the mountain are in the death zone, a mountaineering term for altitudes above a certain point \xe2\x80\x93 around 8,000 m (26,000 ft), or less than 356 millibars (5.16 psi) of atmospheric pressure \xe2\x80\x93 where the oxygen pressure level is not sufficient to sustain human life. Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (unwise decisions made under stress or physical weakening leading to accidents). In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize, as it uses oxygen faster than it can be</s>"

He was designed by Kishimoto as the "cool genius" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke\'s older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.[ch. 224] Because of this, Sasuke\'s sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal.</s>'

According to Fujio, it was originally conceived following a series of three events: when searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him, he tripped over his daughter\'s toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood. To set up the plot and characters, he inspired some elements from his earlier manga series, Obake no Q-Tar\xc5\x8d, which involve an obake living with humans, with a similar formula. Fujio said that the idea for Doraemon came after "an accumulation of trial and error", during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him. Initially, the series achieved little success as gekiga was well-known at the time, and only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films.Doraemon is mainly aimed at children, so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as circles and ellipses.

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa.

There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot. == History == Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made</s>"

With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the 2008 Summer Olympics the record for most competing nations in a sporting event. Some controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match, and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant. As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South</s>"

Context: b'<s>what is the boiling point of water?</s></s>Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is ____[ 100 \xc2\xb0C or 212 \xc2\xb0F]____  but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes. Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes and viruses that may be present. The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies, but if water is held at 100 \xc2\xb0C (212 \xc2\xb0F) for one minute, most micro-organisms and viruses are inactivated. Ten minutes at a temperature of 70 \xc2\xb0C (158 \xc2\xb0F) is also sufficient for most bacteria. Boiling water is also used in several cooking methods including boiling, steaming, and poaching.</s>'

In 1983, the characters were turned into plush teddy bears. The characters headlined their own television series called Care Bears from 1985 to 1988. They also made three feature films: The Care Bears Movie (1985), Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation (1986), and The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland (1987). Each Care Bear is a different color and has a special "belly badge" that represents its personality. Adding to the Care Bear family are the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, lamb, dog, cat, and horse created in the same style as the Care Bears. In 2002, new versions of the bears were manufactured by Play-Along Toys. These new Care Bears appeared in three computer animated films: Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot (2004), The Care Bears\' Big Wish Movie (2005), and Care Bears: Oopsy Does It! (2007).

Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter</s>'

Context: b'<s>how to make the chocolate?</s></s>Chocolate is a food product made from ____[ roasted and ground cacao pods]____ , that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter</s>'

Context: b'<s>how to make chocolate?</s></s>Chocolate is a food product made from ____[ roasted and ground cacao pods]____ , that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE), and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa</s>'

Context: b"<s>how to make coffee?</s></s>Brewed coffee is made by ____[ pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans]____ , then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot. == History == Paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1954 the Wigomat, invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany being the first electrical drip brewer. Drip brew coffee makers replaced the coffee percolator in the 1970s due to the percolators' tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed of together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are now also common, made</s>"

Context: b'<s>what is the boiling point of water?</s></s>Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types. The boiling point of water is ____[ 100 C or 212 F]____  but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes. Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes and viruses that may be present. The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies, but if water is held at 100 C (212 F) for one minute, most micro-organisms and viruses are inactivated. Ten minutes at a temperature of 70 C (158 F) is also sufficient for most bacteria. Boiling water is also used in several cooking methods including boiling, steaming, and poaching.</s>'

A similar question does not involve whether or not an unobserved event occurs predictably, like it occurs when it is observed. The anthropic principle suggests that the observer, just in its existence, may impose on the reality observed. However, most people, as well as scientists, assume that the observer doesn\'t change whether the tree-fall causes a sound or not, but this is an impossible claim to prove. However, many scientists would argue that a truly unobserved event is one which realises no effect (imparts no information) on any other (where \'other\' might be e.g., human, sound-recorder or rock), it therefore can have no legacy in the present (or ongoing) wider physical universe. It may then be recognized that the unobserved event was absolutely identical to an event which did not occur at all.

The Celsius temperature scale was defined until 1954 by two points: 0 C being defined by the water freezing point and 100 C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid. The vapor "Boiling point" will boil at different temperatures. The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid.

The next shock came in 1926 when Max Born proposed that mechanics were to be understood as a probability without any causal explanation. Einstein rejected this interpretation.

Context: b'<s>what color of the sky?</s></s>" ____[Bluegreen]____  distinction in language" color of the sky"" from the Arabic word for sky. (Note: all of these can be written as ""-a kijani"", ""-a majani"", ""-a samwati"", etc.) Zulu and Xhosa use the word ""-luhlaza"" (the prefix changes according to the class of the noun) for ""blue/green"". Tswana uses the same word ""tala"" to refer to both blue and green. One has to deduce from the context and prior knowledge, of what is being talked about, to be able to pinpoint exactly the color in question. The Himba people use a single word for shades of green and blue: ""buru"". They curiously have "Film colorization" (1) common ""memory"" colors such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones and green grass, and (2) based on any known information about the movie.

Context: b'<s>what is the color of the cloud?</s></s>"Atmospheric optics" By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, it may be that a percentage of the light which enters the cloud is not reflected back out before it is absorbed. A simple example of this is being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from ____[ white to black]____ . Other colors occur naturally in clouds. Bluish-grey is the "Cloud iridescence" edges or in semi-transparent clouds, while newly forming clouds produce the brightest and most colorful iridescence. When the particles in a thin cloud are very similar in size over a large extent, the iridescence takes on the structured form of a corona, a bright circular disk around the Sun or Moon surrounded by one or more colored rings. Cloud iridescence Cloud iridescence or irisation is a colorful optical phenomenon that occurs in a cloud and appears in the general proximity of the Sun or Moon.

Since we also know that pressure and temperature are directly proportional so water at high pressure will have high boiling point and at low pressure will have low boiling point. When we maintain vacuum (pressure below atmospheric pressure) the water begins to boil at temperature lower than 100 degree Celsius. Here is table showing the variation of boiling point of water with pressure. Here's a look at what the boiling point of milk is and the factors that affect it. Answer: The boiling point of milk is close to the boiling point of water, which is 100C or 212F at sea level, but milk contains additional molecules in it, so its boiling point is slightly higher. Boiling water. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor.imilarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased. There are two conventions regarding the standard boiling point of water: The normal boiling point is 99.97 C (211.9 F) at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa).</s>"

George Best was one of the most talented players of all time and probably the best footballer who never made it to a major world final.. He was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland, scoring nine goals. Absolutely the BEST SOCCER PLAYER OF ALL TIME IS RONALDO = THE KING I can't forget the 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP that he played. Actually he didn't play, he mesmerized all people of the WORLD. Cristiano success on and off the field is unstoppable and the footballer shows no signs of slowing down! The pro player has much to be thankful for on his birthday since he beat out Lionel Messi, 27, and Manuel Neuer, 27, on Jan. 12 for the coveted title of Ballon DOr, aka the Worlds Best Player.</s>"

What is the 5th longest river in France? The 5th longest river in France is known as the ____[ Dordogne]____ . This river is 483km long, and stretches from the Massif Central in the centre of France westwards to the Atlantic Ocean. The fifth longest river in France cuts a large number of steep gorges near its source. What I find fascinating is that the Danube River used to be the longest river in Europe before the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. Since then, the longest river is Volga, with the length of 3,692 kilometres (2,294 miles).When you consider the river Breg as the source, the Danube is 2,888 kilometers (1,794 miles) long.When compared to all the rivers, the Danube is only the 40th longest river in the world.hat I find fascinating is that the Danube River used to be the longest river in Europe before the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.

The longest river in the world is the Nile River, located in Africa. From its source in the country of Burundi to its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea, it extends for 4,145 miles (6,670 kilometers).

The average American car payment ranges between $380 and $460 dollars per month. between $4.5 billion and $5.2 billion. There is an example from the Wall Street Journal that uses this style, citing: between $50 million and $57 million per season. You can also omit the first billion since your decimal of 4.5 probably won't be confused with $4.50.here is an example in writing here which refers to the range between $85 and $190 million, so you can expect that people would understand the omitted million or billion. Though there are examples for both, it may be best to keep both billions in formal writing, so as to decrease any possible ambiguity.</s>"

An economic want would be something like having a home to live in. A non-economic want would be something like a loving family. Source(s): They aren't.

Cool (aesthetic) Coolness is an aesthetic of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance and style which is generally admired. Because of the varied and changing connotations of cool, as well as its subjective nature, the word has no single meaning.

Although commonly regarded as slang, it is widely used among disparate social groups and has endured in usage for generations.</s>"

The name comes from the cell-like structure of these networks. There is some confusion about cell phones being a different thing to smartphones, but technically, every mobile phone, from the latest Android handset to the simplest feature phone, is a cell phone. It is all about the technology used to transmit your calls, rather than what the handset itself can or cannot do. As long as a phone can transmit a signal to a cellular network, it is a cell phone.

After that, you will learn how to give the girl a good vibe so that she will feel relaxed around you and attracted by you. If you like a girl you have to go and talk to her. Once you talk to the girl you like and make her feel safe and comfortable around you, you can make her your next girlfriend.If you would like a more detailed explanation about this then go to my website and download my free ebook called: how to get a girlfriend.ttp://how2getagirlfriend.com how to get a girlfriend easily by ____[ following 8 simple steps of dating and attraction]____ .
